This is a basic automation wizard form utilizing React/Typscript/Material UI. A user can navigate the multi-step, add information and submit their automation values. I decided to only implement textboxes and spent time to closely match the design.

All in all this took 4 work days to build and demonstrates my abilities as a Front End Scientician ðŸš€.
